Here are five more recipes specifically for weight
training:

1. Protein-packed smoothie: Blend together
   a banana, 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein
   powder, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, 1 cup of
   almond milk, and ice. This smoothie is high in
   protein and healthy fats, making it perfect for
   pre or post-workout fuel.

2. Greek yogurt parfait: In a glass or jar, layer
   plain Greek yogurt, fresh berries, and
   granola. Greek yogurt is high in protein and
   low in fat, and the berries provide a good
   source of antioxidants. The granola adds
   a satisfying crunch.

3. Baked sweet potato wedges: Cut a sweet potato
   into wedges, toss with olive oil, and season
   with garlic powder, paprika, and salt. Bake in
   the oven at 400°F for 20-25 minutes or until
   crispy. Sweet potatoes are a good source of
   carbs and vitamin A, making them an excellent
   energy source for weight training.

4. Turkey and veggie stir-fry: In a pan, sauté
   ground turkey with chopped veggies such as bell
   peppers, broccoli, and carrots. Season with soy
   sauce and garlic, and serve over brown
   rice. This meal is high in protein and complex
   carbs, providing sustained energy for weight
   training.

5. Tuna and avocado wrap: Mix canned tuna with
   diced avocado, chopped celery, and a squeeze of
   lemon juice. Spread onto a whole-grain wrap and
   top with spinach leaves. Tuna is high in
   protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which can help
   reduce inflammation in the body.
