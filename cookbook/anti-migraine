hello! earlier you provided me with this list --
could you please help me turn it into a grocery
list?

1. Migraine-busting smoothie: A smoothie made with
   spinach, ginger, blueberries, and almond
   milk. Spinach and ginger have anti-inflammatory
   properties, while blueberries are high in
   antioxidants.

2. Magnesium-rich salad: A salad made with leafy
   greens, avocado, almonds, and quinoa. Leafy
   greens are high in magnesium, which can help
   alleviate migraines, and avocado is a good
   source of healthy fats.

3. Anti-inflammatory wrap: A wrap made with
   turmeric-spiced chicken, spinach, bell peppers,
   and hummus. Turmeric is a powerful
   anti-inflammatory spice that can help reduce
   migraines.

4. Omega-3-packed oatmeal: Oatmeal made with chia
   seeds, walnuts, and flaxseed. Chia seeds and
   flaxseed are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which
   can help reduce inflammation and improve brain
   function.

5. Migraine-fighting smoothie bowl: A smoothie
   bowl made with acai berries, banana, kale, and
   almond butter. Acai berries are high in
   antioxidants, while kale is a good source of
   magnesium.
