6. Endurance-boosting smoothie: Blend together
   1 banana, 1 cup of frozen berries, 1 tablespoon
   of honey, 1 tablespoon of chia seeds, 1 cup of
   coconut water, and ice. This smoothie is high
   in electrolytes, carbs, and antioxidants,
   making it perfect for endurance training.

7. Brain-boosting breakfast bowl: In a bowl, mix
   together cooked quinoa, almond milk, chopped
   nuts, cinnamon, and honey. Top with fresh
   berries and sliced bananas. Quinoa is high in
   protein and complex carbs, while nuts provide
   healthy fats and antioxidants.

8. Gut-healing soup: In a pot, sauté chopped
   onions, garlic, and ginger. Add bone broth,
   chopped carrots, celery, and kale, and simmer
   until the vegetables are tender. This soup is
   packed with nutrients and amino acids that help
   heal and protect the gut.

9. Cardiovascular-boosting salad: Mix together
   baby spinach leaves, sliced strawberries,
   crumbled feta cheese, sliced almonds, and
   a balsamic vinaigrette. Spinach is high in
   magnesium, which is important for heart health,
   while strawberries are packed with
   antioxidants.

10. Kidney-supporting bowl: In a bowl, mix
    together cooked brown rice, steamed broccoli,
    baked salmon, sliced avocado, and a drizzle of
    soy sauce. Salmon is high in omega-3 fatty
    acids, which can help improve kidney function,
    while avocado provides healthy fats and
    potassium.

11. Nervous system-boosting smoothie: Blend
    together 1 banana, 1 cup of frozen
    blueberries, 1 tablespoon of almond butter,
    1 tablespoon of honey, 1 cup of almond milk,
    and ice. Blueberries are high in antioxidants,
    while almond butter provides healthy fats and
    protein.

12. Sensory-boosting dinner: In a pan, sauté
    sliced mushrooms, onions, and garlic. Add
    cooked quinoa and vegetable broth, and simmer
    until heated through. Top with chopped walnuts
    and parsley. Mushrooms are high in vitamin D,
    which is important for vision and immune
    function, while walnuts are packed with
    omega-3 fatty acids, which can help improve
    brain function.
