A *-algebra is a type of algebraic structure that
consists of a complex Banach space (a complete
normed vector space), along with two operations: 

1. A multiplication operation that is associative
   and distributive over addition

2. A map * : A â†’ A that is involutionary (a** = a)
   and antilinear (it reverses the order of
   multiplication and takes complex conjugates)

Here are the properties:

1. If a and b are elements of the algebra, then so
   is their product ab.

2. For all a, b, c in the algebra, 
   (ab)c = a(bc) (associativity)

3. There is an identity element 1 such that 
   a1 = 1a = a for all a in the algebra

4. For each a in the algebra, there is an element
   called a* in the algebra, called the adjoint of
   a.

5. For all a and b in the algebra, (a+b)* = a* + b*

6. For all a and b in the algebra, (ab)* = b*a*

7. For all a in the algebra, (a*)* = a

8. The norm ||a*|| = ||a|| for all a in the algebra.

9. For all a in the algebra, ||a*a|| = ||a||^2

I would like to make sure our code properly encapsulates these ideas
